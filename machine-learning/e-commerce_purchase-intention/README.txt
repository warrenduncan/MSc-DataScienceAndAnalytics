The following is a project that was completed during the MSc Data Science and Anlytic through Cardiff
University.

The aim of the project was to create a machine learning model that best predicted the purchasing intention of
visitors to an ecommerce website. In addition to this a report was required (limited to 1000 words) which 
explained the process followed and discussed the results. Different sections were given different weightings
in terms of marks, hence certain areas of the report may be discussed in greater detail.

Three machine learning models were compared, namely a Logisitcal Regression model, a Support Vector Machine model,
and a Random Forrest model. The models were compared and and the model with the best results was selected.

Python libraries used in the analysis include: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlob, scipy.
Python linraries used to preprocess the data and build the models include: sklearn, imblearn

FILE DESCRIPTIONS:
 	* e-commerce_data.csv: The csv file of data, as received by the university.
 	* purchase-intention_code.ipynb: A jupyter notebook contataining all the code pertaining to the analysis,
					 preprocessing, and model creation. All code is written in the Python 
					 programming language.
 	* findings-report_MSc-submission.pdf : The report submitted for evaluation. Note the report was written
					       specifically for academic purposes and for submission to Cardiff
					       university. Thus, the content, style, and formatting of the report
					       has been selected appropriately.
